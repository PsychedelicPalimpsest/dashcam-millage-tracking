## Simple dashcam millige tracker



This is yet another attempt at a 'better' way to track business miles for Doordash/UberEats gig work. This program OCRs and computes millage based off the gps data from a `Viofo A119 Dash Cam`. And that model only. If you wish to change resolution, you will need to edit `CONFIG.py` with exact pixel messurements. 


This method should be highly accurate, and generates detailed records.
